I am ready now <br>
They seem happy to be melting <br>
All under someone's reign<br>

Hold it steady now<br>
I'll point where you should be aiming<br>
It's all worth the pain
<br>
Doubting becomes that itch in your gums<br>
A sudden need to bite<br>
Your blood and teeth<br>
Get mixed with the sweet<br>
And it all turns into spite<br>
A rock of solid sugar<br>
<br>
I can follow him<br>
With his eyes like a coyote<br>
That can conjure an earthquake<br>

I will challenge them<br>
Do everything he told me<br>
Turn their crosses into snakes<br>

Doubting becomes that itch in your gums<br>
A sudden need to bite<br>
Your blood and teeth<br>
Get mixed with the sweet<br>
And it all turns into spite<br>
A rock of solid sugar<br>

Twenty nine<br>
All is mine<br>
Neon sign<br>
Stars align<br>
